# 🤙 👍 🌿 STEPS TO INSTALL THE PACKAGE ON YOUR TERMINAL 🥰 🙂 😃
#************************************************************************************
        1) INSTALL NODE JS ON UR TERMINAL
        
        2) INSTALL VS CODE AND SOME JavaScript extensions
        
              * Prettier
              * JavaScript (ES6) Code Snippets
              * Node.js Modules Intellisense
              * Bracket pair colorizer
              
        
        2) Create a new project folder
        
                * mkdir command   (folder created )
                * cd command      ( directory changed)
                * touch index.js  (our file where we'll code)
                
        3) Execute The following commands to create a JSON FILE
                
                *npm init -y
                
        4) Copy the provided code into your index.js file from my index.js file
            # NOTE : provide the shebang line in order to execute bash/script commands
            
                * ! /usr/bin/env node  
        5)  We will be writing todo Tasks in a file called todo.txt and when they will be completed they 
             will be erased from todo.txt and will be written in done.txt.
 
              
        6) Install various dependencies for this C-L-I
         
              * npm install colors
              * npm i --save-dev nodemon
              * npm i log-update
         7) After writing the code simply run the file using 
              
              * node index.js
              
         # NOTE 😬 🥶  
         if it throws error statements.
          
          # SOLUTION:-
            *********
            * type ls in your project directory
                  check whether your index.js file has an executable permission or not
                      if not then we need to change the permission to an executable file
                      type the following comnds:-
                        
                          * chmod +x index.js
                      // and good to go
